{"name":"WikiDAT","tagline":"Wikipedia Data Analysis Toolkit","body":"### Project Info\r\n* **Authors**: Felipe Ortega, Aaron Halfaker.\r\n* **License**: [GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt).\r\n\r\nThe aim of WikiDAT is to create an extensible toolkit for Wikipedia Data \r\nAnalysis, based on [Python](http://www.python.org/) and [R](http://www.r-project.org/). Currently, [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) is the only supported DB backend, but there are plans to include other DB engines in the future.\r\n\r\n<p>Each module implements a different type of analysis and it stores the output in \r\nsubdirectories <i>results</i>, <i>figs</i> or <i>traces</i>, inside the module's maind folder. \r\nEvery module includes Python and R code to implement both the data \r\npreparation, cleaning and analysis steps, including inline comments. \r\nAn important goal is to illustrate different case examples of \r\ninteresting analyses with Wikipedia data, following a didactic approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The long-term goal is to include more case examples progressively, in order \r\nto cover many of the usual examples of quantitative analyses that can be \r\nimplemented on Wikipedia data. In the future, this may also include the use \r\nof tools for distributed computing to support analysis of really huge data \r\nsets in high-resolution studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<b>Required dependencies</b>\r\nThe following software dependencies are required to run all examples currently\r\nincluded in WikiDAT:\r\n\r\n* [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) server and client (>= v5.5).\r\n* [Python](http://www.python.org/) programming language (>= v2.7 bu < v3) and \r\n[Python MySQLdb](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/) (>= v1.2.3)\r\n* R project for statistical computing (>= v2.15.0).\r\n\r\nAdditional [R packages](http://cran.r-project.org/) with extra data and functionalities (This list will be updated as new functionalities are included):\r\n\r\n* [RMySQL](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RMySQL/index.html): Connect to MySQL dbs from R.\r\n* [Hmisc](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Hmisc/index.html): Frank Harrell's miscelaneous functions (essential).\r\n* [car](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/car/index.html): Companion package for \"R Companion to Applied Regression\", 2nd ed.\r\n* [DAAG](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DAAG/index.html): Companion package for \"Data Analysis and Graphics using R.\"\r\n* [ineq](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ineq/index.html): Calcualte inequality metrics and graphics.\r\n* [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/): A wonderful package to create appealing graphics in R.\r\n* [eha](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/eha/index.html): Package for event history and survival analysis.\r\n* [zoo](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zoo/index.html): Excellent library to handle timeseries data.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
